# Getting Started

## Installation requirements

Gridap is tested on Linux, but it should be also possible to use it on Mac OS and Windows since it is written exclusively in Julia and it only depends on registered Julia packages.

## Installation

Gridap is a registered package. Thus, the installation should be straight forward using the Julia's package manager [Pkg](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/v1/). To this end, open the Julia REPL (i.e., execute the `julia` binary), type `]` to enter package mode, and install Gridap as follows

```julia
pkg> add Gridap
```

That's all.

For further information about how to install and manage Julia packages, see the
[Pkg documentation](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/v1/).

## Further steps

We recommend to follow the [Gridap Tutorials](https://gridap.github.io/Tutorials/dev/) in order to get familiar with the library.
